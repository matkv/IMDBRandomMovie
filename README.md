# IMDBRandomMovie

Get a random movie from your IMDB watchlist.

This program uses selenium to login to your IMDB account and downloads your watchlist as csv and then picks a random movie.
The email & password of your IMDB account and the default download folder of your Chrome browser have to be set first.

This has currently only been tested using Manjaro Linux.
